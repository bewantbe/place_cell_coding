Understanding of Place Cell-like Coding

Idealized system
================

Suppose the subject (with brain) is living in a 1-dimensional space.

There are cells that response to the position in the space, called place cells. 
Each cell has a bell-shape like response when moving position, and different 
cell has max response center at different position.

Now consider construct a decoder, that decode the position from the cell 
responses. For simplicity, we require the decoder output a coordinate of 
the postition.

Thought:

1.
How simple can be the decoder?
We may have three level of decoder: (1) rate based neuron without any
 measurement noise; (2) rate-based neuron with noise in bell-shape and 
 measurement; (3) spiking neuron with limited time measurement.

1.1
It seems that in the setup (1), the decoder can be accomplished by a simple
linear weighted summation. We need to write a code to verify it.
If it is true then (2) (3) can be impliemnted the same way.

2.
Decoded result, the coordinate, is an abstract representation of the position.
The process of from position to place cell response is a mental sensing of place.
The decoder is a process that matches the mental sensing with abstract representation.

3.
The decoded result can be used to instruct limb movement or served as a goal for
movement, such as the arm-reaching.

4.
The population place field (response of all place cells) and coordinate-like
 response are two equivalant ways for representing postion.
It seems that there are few algorithms that are based on the place field 
 representation.
We may try to construct such algorithm.

5.
This place field v.s. coordinate representation relationship, due to its
 simplicity, may exist other system of brain. This is yet to explorer.

5.1
Maybe the receptive field of visual system, can be understood the same way.

5.2
Maybe the mental attention can be understood the same way.
